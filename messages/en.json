            "Title": "This is how MovingGo Max works, via our app or website:",
            "Step1": "You have a task to sell: If you have a task, for example in the moving industry or any other industry, that you cannot take on or want to sell forward, you can easily do so through MovingGo Max, either via our app or website.",
            "Step2": "Log in and describe the task: Log in via our app or website, describe the task in detail (e.g., moving from one location to another, delivery of construction materials, or a service), and publish it. The more information you provide, the clearer it becomes for potential buyers.",
            "Step3": "Other companies see your task: All companies using MovingGo Max, via the app or website, receive the task in their feed. They can either buy the task directly or place bids if you choose to accept offers.",
            "Step4": "Choose a buyer: When several companies have shown interest, you can choose the company you think is best suited to take over the task – either based on price, experience, or reviews from previous collaborations.",
            "Step5": "Evaluate the buyer: When the task is complete, you can evaluate the buyer and their service. This way, you help other companies on the platform make well-informed decisions about who they want to collaborate with in the future."
